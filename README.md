# GKI 2026: Three Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains three complete machine learning projects from Gervigreindakeppni Íslands 2026.

1. **Classification_Project_2** - Icelandic Habitat Classification
2. **TimeSeries_Project_3** - Hot Water Demand Forecasting
3. **NLP_Project_1** - Byte-level Language Modeling (Golden Plate)

Each project is self-contained with its own reproducible pipeline, code, and documentation.

## Project Summaries

### Classification_Project_2: Icelandic Habitat Classification

**Task:** Classify 35×35 satellite image patches into one of 71 Icelandic habitat types.

**Input:** 15-channel satellite imagery (12 Sentinel-2 bands + elevation + slope + aspect)

**Approach:** Ensemble of tabular and CNN models.
- Tabular models: ExtraTrees, LightGBM, PyTorch MLP (hand engineered features).
- CNN models: Small CNN, ResNet variants (image based).
- Final ensemble: 4-model weighted average.

**Key Files:**
- `api.py` - FastAPI endpoint for predictions.
- `README.md` - Full reproducible pipeline and setup instructions.

**Location:** [`Classification_Project_2/`](Classification_Project_2/)

### TimeSeries_Project_3: Hot Water Demand Forecasting

**Task:** Forecast 72-hour (3-day) hot water demand for 45 sensors given 672-hour (28-day) history and weather data.

**Input:** Historical sensor readings + weather forecasts + observations

**Approach:** Ensemble of tree-based models with hierarchical reconciliation.
- LightGBM (per sensor, weather aware).
- ExtraTrees (for diversity).
- Equal weighting, optional hierarchical reconciliation.

**Key Files:**
- `api.py` - FastAPI endpoint for real-time forecasts.
- `scripts/build_train_full.py` - Data pipeline.
- `scripts/train_models.py` - Model training.
- `README.md` - Full setup and reproducible pipeline.

**Location:** [`TimeSeries_Project_3/`](TimeSeries_Project_3/)

### NLP_Project_1: Byte-level Language Modeling

**Task:** Train a tiny byte-level (0–255) next-byte prediction model under strict constraints.

**Constraints:**
- <= 1 MB submission size.
- CPU only inference.
- Metric: bits per byte (BPB).

**Approach:** Quantized GRU language model.
- 1-2 layer GRU with embeddings and linear output.
- Int8 weight quantization plus fp16 scaling for size efficiency.
- Achieves competitive BPB on held-out validation data.

**Key Files:**
- `submission/model.py` - Evaluator entry point.
- `scripts/train_tiny_gru.py` - Training script.
- `submission/gru_config.json` - Model configuration.
- `README.md` - Setup and training instructions.

**Location:** [`NLP_Project_1/`](NLP_Project_1/)

## Competition Result

This submission placed **2nd** in the university division and **8th** overall on the test set.

## Getting Started

Each project is independent. To work on a specific project, run:

```bash
cd Classification_Project_2
# or
cd TimeSeries_Project_3
# or
cd NLP_Project_1
```

Then see the project's **README.md** for detailed setup, data requirements, and reproducible pipeline instructions.

## Notes

- Each project has a `.gitignore` that excludes large artifacts like data and trained models, but tracks code, configs, and submission files.
- Complete reproducible pipelines are documented in each project README.
- Experimental and auxiliary scripts are noted and explained in project-specific READMEs.

For detailed information on any project, see the respective **README.md** file.
